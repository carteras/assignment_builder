**Task**

This assignment is intended to be done in pairs.

Some people say you only understand something once you try to teach
others. This assignment attempts to engage students in a hands-on
learning experience by having them conceptualise, design, create,
implement, and then reflect on creating a CTF-style challenge and the
tutorials required to teach students concepts. 

## Conceptualisation

[]{.mark}

You must conceptualise a cybersecurity/programming challenge based on
your exposure to previous topics or through your research. Examples of
challenges include programming, system commands, security tools, or
something you have discovered independently. 

This stage encourages students to think creatively and apply their
knowledge novelly. 

## Research and Design 

After selecting a challenge, students will research and design the
specifics, including the process a learner would undergo to solve it and
the resources required for construction. 

This stage involves critical thinking and problem-solving. You must
anticipate potential obstacles and devise appropriate solutions. 

## Implementation 

Students will bring their design to life by creating the finished
product, [a markdown
document](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/markdown#:~:text=Markdown is a lightweight markup,%2C bullets%2C and so on.)
for CTFd, a Google form for peer review, build scripts for automation
(if required), and a tutorial (in a recipe/poster format) for others on
how to solve the challenge. 

This stage showcases your technical expertise and ability to create
comprehensive, user-friendly resources. The implementation process will
encourage you to improve your documentation and communication skills. 

## Reflection

Lastly, you will write a short reflection on the entire experience
incorporating feedback from your peers. This reflection is intended to
enable students to evaluate their process and identify improvement areas
critically. 

**Outputs**

 

You must produce a [markdown
document](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/markdown#:~:text=Markdown is a lightweight markup,%2C bullets%2C and so on.)
with your challenge for CTFd. 

You must produce your challenge material, including any build scripts
and documentation, to allow the material to be deployed. 

Additionally, you must construct two A3 posters (templates provided).

[]{.mark}

Poster 1 must include the following: 

The conceptualisation of your challenge 

-   a brief description of your challenge

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   explanation of the challenges relevant to networking, systems,
    and/or security

Research and Design

-   Documentation of the challenge, including the intended learning
    outcomes

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   required material

Reflection

-   a short reflection discussing the following process, including the
    following points

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Overall experience

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   challenges faced and how they were overcome

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   areas of improvement

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   the value of collaboration and peer feedback

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   What was learnt, that could be useful in future projects

[]{.mark}

[Poster 2:]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[You will provide your "recipe" tutorial. This recipe will guide the
user step by step to solve the problem given.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

Lastly, you must include a short note documenting: 

-   What percentage of work each member of the group did.

## Rubric sections

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to you to decide
how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required unit
goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem-solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

Students are expected to provide a submission that fulfils the
requirements listed in style guides while also submitting at an
appropriate quality. Be aware that points in this section could be 2- or
4-point items. Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code or code copied and pasted into a document
may not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, to show how your robot meets a requirement, you must submit a
recording of it completing that requirement. Similarly, if you need to
show how your program can download a file from the internet and crack a
password, you must submit a recording of it doing that.

Ask the teacher if you are unsure if an element needs to be
recorded**.**

All materials must be submitted to Google Classroom.

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master copies.

"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification on specific tasks

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points. 

##### 2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding

Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to effectively state facts and define terms and concepts.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.

##### 4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review

To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will demonstrate their ability to
show higher-order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or linking
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.

## Analysis and Synthesis

Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data. In contrast, synthesis combines
experience from one area with other pertinent knowledge to develop an
original and compelling solution.

##### Expert Review

Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using the
skills taught during the semester. Criteria assessed as 4-Points are
classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These will examine and
evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data and
understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant statement.
Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from interpreting the
data. In contrast, synthesis combines experience from one area with
other pertinent knowledge to develop an original and compelling

##### Multiplier

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

## Achievement Standards: 

## Evidence of higher-order learning: 

What is it that I mean by "higher-order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond replicating what we do in class. I want
you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something, what
about it was great, and what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers can go beyond what they are
taught and can customise their learning to ben
